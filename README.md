# Spare-5---Task-Checker
Check for tasks of Spare 5
Old Project
Spare 5: https://app.spare5.com/fives
Spare 5 is a tasking website where users can earn small amounts of money for doing simple tasks such as tagging images.
This program launches a new instance of chrome with the TASK ID predefined in the UI and then simply waits 2 seconds for the webpage to load
if the URL changes to the home page (i.e. task of that specific ID was not found) the program closes the tab by invoking the control-w shortcut
the program then waits for x-seconds, x is chosen by the user.

Note:
This was a small project made out of boredom.
